    <h2>The Battle</h2>
<p>The Battle of Stalingrad was the bloodiest battle of both The Second World War, and all of world history. The battle was a Soviet counterattack on the city of Stalingrad in an attempt to both protect the city of Stalin’s name and prevent the Germans from capturing the oilfields of the Caucasus. The battle lasted 6 months over a brutal winter and resulted in the withdrawal of the German army from southern Russia and led to a general withdrawal throughout the Eastern front.</p>
<div class="text">
<p>The armies that were involved in the Battle were the German Army Group B, which contained 1,040,000 men and was comprised of the 6th Army and 4th Panzer Army. The opposing side was the Soviet Russian Stalingrad Front, which contained 1,143,000 men and 28th, 51st, 57th, 62nd, and 64th Army. The battle was the bloodiest ever fought, with the German army suffering a colossal 728,000 casualties, and the Soviets an even greater 1,129,619 men.</p>

<p>The Battle of Stalingrad began with a German assault on the city, and subsequent Luftwaffe bombing, that reduced the city the rubble. The initial German assault was successful but as the Germans pushed deeper into the city the Soviet resistance grew fiercer and the battle degenerated into street to street fighting. Both the German and Soviet armies kept sending hundreds of thousands of troops into the Stalingrad meat grinder. The battle was a constant back and forth for the land West of the Volga River and hundreds of thousands of Russians died just to take a few kilometres. The Battle of Stalingrad was exceptionally brutal, with the average lifetime of a Russian soldier west of the Volga being around 1 day.

<p>The battle lasted for 5 months over a brutal blizzard, and resulted in a total of 1,947,000 casualties out of the close to 2.5 million men that fought in the battle. After 5 months of brutal fighting, the German army was forced to retreat Stalingrad, leaving the Soviets with a phyrric victory and a completely destroyed city</p>
