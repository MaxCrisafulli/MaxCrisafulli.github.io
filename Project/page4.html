    <h2>The Battle</h2>
<p>The Battle of Tannenberg was one of the most decisive battles of the First World War. The battle was a German counterattack to a Russian invasion of East Prussia during the opening months of the war. The battle resulted in the complete annihilation of the Russian Second Army, and was a major strategic and propaganda victory for the German Empire.</p>

<p>The armies that fought in the Battle of Tannenberg were the Imperial German Eighth Army under Paul von Hindenburg against the Russian Second Army under Aleksandr Samsonov. The Imperial German Eighth Army numbered 150,000 soldiers and the Imperial Russian Second Army under Aleksandr Samsonov numbered 230,000. The German army, winning a decisive victory suffered 14,000 casualties which paled in comparison to the enormous Russian casualties of 170,000.</p>

  <p>The opening moves of the battles involved the Russians crossing the East Prussian frontier five days earlier than the Germans were expecting. This was a result of the Russians secretly mobilising their military a week before they officially declared that they were. This caused the Germans to be slightly off guard but they had reorganised before the initial assault commenced. </p>

<p>The battle played out with the Germans advancing towards the Russians in a well organised column that could communicate efficiently due to switchboard operators remaining at their posts by government order. The Germans and Russians skirmished for most of the day until the Germans broke through on the Russian flanks and encircled the entire second army. A few hours later saw the Russian Second Army completely destroyed, and 78,000 Russians killed and 92,000 captured. </p>
