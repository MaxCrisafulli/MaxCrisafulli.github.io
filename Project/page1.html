    <h2>The Battle</h2>
  <p class=”text”>The Battle of Towton was the largest   battle of the English Wars of the Roses, which were fought from 1455 to 1487. The Battle itself is one of the bloodiest ever fought on English soil, and the most brutal one. The Battle of Towton was fought outside the town of Towton, Yorkshire, during a strong Blizzard.</p>
  <p>The armies that fought the Battle of Towton were the Yorkist Army under Edward, Duke of York, against the Lancastrian Army, under Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. Due to the battle taking place on English soil and the armies being comprised entirely of Englishmen, the armies were primarily comprised of bow-wielding peasant infantry. The bows that the infantry used were powerful longbows, and the infantry was skilled in using them, having been trained from birth by law. The rest of the armies were comprised of heavily-armoured knights, and armoured men-at-arms. </p>

  <p class=”text”>The battle opened with Yorkist forces setting up defensively on a hill, with the Lancastrian forces below. The opening actions of the battles involved numerous volleys of deadly arrows, which are said to have accounted for the majority of casualties. The Lancastrians then charged the Yorkists, with the Lancastrian cavalry assaulting the Yorkist left flank. The Yorkist flank almost collapsed until the cavalry was repulsed by Edward and his guard.</p>

   <div class="text">
   <p class="text">The fighting continued indecisively for 3 hours until a large contingent of men under John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk arrived and pushed the battle decisively in favour of the Yorkists. The Lancastrian army was slaughtered and the thousands of bodies were stripped of armour and buried in mass graves, ending the bloodiest battle of English history.</p>
