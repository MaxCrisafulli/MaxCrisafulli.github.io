    <h2>The Battle</h2>
<p>The Battle of Gettysburg was the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865. Battle of Gettysburg was a response by a major thrust by Confederate forces into Pennsylvania, in an attempt to force them back into Virginia. The battle significantly weakened the offensive capability of the Confederate Army, and was one of the most important battles of the Civil War.</p>

<p>The armies that fought in the Battle of Gettysburg were the Union Army of Potomac under George G. Meade, numbering 105,000 soldiers that came into the battle over a course of 2 days, and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee, numbering 75,000 men. The Union Army suffered 23,000 casualties at the end of the battle, while the Confederates suffered 28,000.</p>

<div class=text>
  <p>The battle opened with a series of skirmishes near the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The two armies began to be drawn into the area, with each side trying to gain numerical superiority in an attempt to destroy each otherâ€™s armies. At the second day the armies had assembled in their entirety on the field of battle. The Union forces had assembled into a defensive position resembling a fishhook, and the Confederates had positioned to attack the Union army.</p>

<p>After a few days fighting the Confederate Army had exhausted all their offensive capability in futile uphill attacks against fortified Union positions. On the 3rd of July the Army of Northern Virginia began to withdraw from the battlefield and retreat back into Confederate held Virginia.</p>
