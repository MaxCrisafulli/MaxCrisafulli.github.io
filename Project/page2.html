    <h2>The Battle</h2>
    <p>The Battle of Waterloo was the final battle of the Napoleonic Wars, which were fought from 1803 to 1815. The Battle was fought near the town of Waterloo, in modern-day Belgium, then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The battle while not one of the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars, was one of the most significant, and ended in the removal of Napoleon from power.</p>

    <p>The armies that fought in the Battle of Waterloo was the Anglo-Allied army, consisting of 31,000 British soldiers, and 37,000 Dutch allies, under the command of Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. The Prussian Army, allied to the British, consisted of 50,000 Prussians under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher, while the Prussians fought in the Battle, their main use of delaying large portions of the French army from engaging with the Anglo-Allied forces. The enemy army, the French, was made up of 73,000 soldiers, under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had taken control of France after his escape from the island of Elba. The French Army suffered 41,000 casualties in total, while the British-Dutch-Prussian Army suffered 24,000 in total.</p>

      <div class = "text">
          <p>The Battle of Waterloo opened with the Prussians being defeated at Wavre, and the Dutch being defeated at Wavre. This caused the Duke of Wellington to withdraw his army to Waterloo, where he set up and awaited an attack from Napoleon's army, that had been reduced to ⅔ its size having ⅓ being sent to pursue the Prussians.</p>

     <p>The British army withstood the numerous French attacks for the duration of the battle, in an effort to hold out until “night or Blucher” as the Duke of Wellington said. Napoleon was awair that he had to win the battle before the Prussians arrived, so in a last-ditch effort Napoleon launched a massive final attack that was only narrowly defeated. The weakness caused by the failed attack allowed Wellington to counter attack Napoleon and win the battle, ending Napoleon's reign as Emperor of the French.</p>
